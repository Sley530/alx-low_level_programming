# C - File I/O

In this project, I learned a lot about the three standard file descriptors and their
`POSIX` names as well as the difference between function and system calls. Moreover, I
practiced using the I/O system calls `open`, `close`, `read`, and `write`
and the flags `O_RDONLY`, `WR_ONLY`, and `O_RDWR` to create, open, close,
read, write, set permissions of files in C.
