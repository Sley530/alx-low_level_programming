# 0x00. C - Hello, World

For thsi project, I learned about the compiling process of C which include 4 parts such as
preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking. Besides, I learned 
how I can use the 'puts' function to display a string of characters in the standard output with a line
and the printf function to display without a newline.
In addition, I learned some data types in C and their corresponding size by using the sizeof function.
